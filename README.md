# CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

This repository contains my notes, assignments, and projects for the [Stanford CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) course.

## Introduction

CS231n is a renowned course offered by Stanford University that covers the foundations and applications of deep learning for computer vision. This repository documents my learning journey through lecture notes, assignment solutions, and personal projects.

## Contents

- `notes/` &mdash; My lecture notes and summaries.
- `assignments/` &mdash; Solutions and code for programming assignments.
- `projects/` &mdash; (Optional) Additional projects or explorations related to the course.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, it is recommended to use a Python virtual environment.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZinanHAN/CS231n_note.git
cd CS231n_note
```

### 2. Setup environment

You can use `venv` or `conda` for environment management. Example with `venv`:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Note: If there is no `requirements.txt`, install the main dependencies manually (e.g., `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `ipython`, `jupyter`, `torch`, etc.).

### 3. Start Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
